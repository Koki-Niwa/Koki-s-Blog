# Intro

## Welcome to Koki's Blog! 🚀  


This website focuses on **technology sharing**.(This is not just an introduction, but also **a reminder to myself**, so that I don’t include unnecessary content.)


Since my English isn’t very good, **most of my posts will be in Chinese**. Still, I’ll do my best to write some **bilingual blogs**.

## Here, I  share:
- My learning process of Compiler Principles (including lecture notes, experiments, and my independent learning notes outside the classroom)
- The complete process of writing a compiler
- Notes on learning other technologies
