In this module, I document the complete process from my first introduction to compiler principles to developing a relatively fully functional C language compiler.


I store my university lecture notes, lab records, and extracurricular study notes here. And, of course, the most important thing—my insights and reflections on this knowledge. The code will be embedded in the documents, with no separate files.

University lecture notes and lab records are stored in the "Class" folder; extracurricular study notes, as well as my insights and reflections, are in the "Notes" folder.


Inevitably, there may be errors in these documents and notes, and I would greatly appreciate it if readers could generously point them out.
